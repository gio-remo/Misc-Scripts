## Misc Scripts

This is the shelter for the scripts that don't have a place to stay.

I wrote them to accomplish small (and most probably repetitive) tasks, to do things, and to do things.

* **loud_idetail_move_asset_images** - Python script to move asset images for Veeva iDetail development.
* **loud_idetail_folders_emptier** - Python script to delete only the content of a list of folders.
* **utility_rename_and_counter** - Python script to rename images adding a counter in the filename.
